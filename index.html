            <p class="dogma-text">Legend has it that $TOKA was not created, but discovered in the Great Doggo Council of 2024. The council, composed of the wisest good boys and girls, declared:</p>
            <blockquote class="bark-block">"No dog shall go treat-less ever again!"</blockquote>
            <p class="dogma-text">Thus, $TOKA was forged in the sacred Dog Bowl of Eternity, powered by an infinite stash of belly rubs and tail wags.</p>

            <h2 class="treat-title">The Prophecy of the Treat Vault</h2>
            <p class="dogma-text">It is said that every $TOKA token is linked to the Vault of Infinite Treats, guarded by the mythical Doge of Prosperity. The more $TOKA you hold, the louder the Vault's lid creaks open, granting you eternal wealth (and snacks).</p>
